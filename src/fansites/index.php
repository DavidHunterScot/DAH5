<p>Here you will find a collection of fan-made websites I have created. The reason behind these are mostly just to practice my web design skills, but also to show off some of the things I am passionate about.</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> Most of the content on a fan-made website will be owned by someone else. Should the original owner of the content wish it taken down, simply write me an email and we can discuss it together amicably. Details on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>
